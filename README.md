# Checkout-Flow-Optimization-Analysis-with-SQL-and-Tableau-Project

Optimizing Checkout Flow Analysis in Tableau

Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and optimizing the checkout flow of an online platform to improve conversion rates and customer satisfaction. By leveraging Tableau, we aim to identify pain points in the payment process, analyze checkout behavior, and provide data-driven recommendations for enhancing the user payment experience.

Objective

The goal is to build a three-page story-based dashboard in Tableau that visualizes key checkout metrics from July 1, 2022, to January 31, 2023. This dashboard will help analyze checkout trends, detect issues, and suggest actionable improvements to streamline the payment process.

User Categorization

Users in the checkout process fall into three categories:
	•	✅ Successful Checkout – Users who complete a payment without issues.
	•	❌ Failed Checkout – Users who attempt to pay but face errors and fail to complete the transaction.
	•	🛒 Abandoned Cart – Users who add a subscription to their cart but leave before purchasing.

Key Metrics for Analysis

To ensure a comprehensive investigation, our Tableau dashboard will focus on:

📊 Monthly Checkout Success Rate
	•	Measures the percentage of successful transactions out of total checkout attempts.
	•	A high rate indicates a smooth checkout process, while a low rate signals potential friction.

🛑 Monthly Cart Abandonment Rate
	•	Shows the percentage of users who added items to their cart but didn’t complete the purchase.
	•	A high abandonment rate suggests issues like complex checkout steps, pricing concerns, or lack of payment options.

🔍 Most Common Checkout Errors & Device Correlations
	•	Identifies the most frequent payment failures and determines if specific devices (mobile, tablet, desktop) are more prone to errors.
	•	Helps optimize the checkout process by addressing device-specific problems.

Project Structure
	•	Checkout_Analysis_Dashboard.twbx – Tableau workbook containing the three-page dashboard.
	•	Checkout_Data.csv – Dataset containing user transactions, cart behavior, and error logs.
	•	README.md – Project documentation.

How to Use This Project
	1.	Load Data into Tableau
	•	Open Checkout_Data.csv in Tableau and explore the dataset.
	2.	Build Visualizations
	•	Create charts, KPIs, and trend lines to track checkout behavior.
	3.	Develop the Story Dashboard
	•	Combine insights into a three-page dashboard showing checkout success, cart abandonment, and error trends.
	4.	Analyze & Recommend Improvements
	•	Identify pain points and propose checkout optimizations based on the findings.

Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights into checkout performance and user payment behavior. By analyzing key metrics, errors, and trends, businesses can enhance the checkout experience, reduce cart abandonment, and improve conversion rates. 💳🚀
